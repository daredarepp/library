With Vagrant and VirtualBox installed, follow these steps to run the project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. From the root of the repository run "vagrant up" command. (Note: if your host OS is Windows, run "vagrant up" in a command-line as administrator. To start a command prompt as an administrator, right-click Command prompt and then click Run as administrator.)

The project is now live at http://localhost:4000  (The port will be changed automatically in case it collides with a port already in use. Vagrant will output information about any collisions detections and auto corrections made.)

To populate the database with the necessary data, go to http://localhost:4000/admin/populate


The movies listed in the project are some of the greatest movies ever made.
